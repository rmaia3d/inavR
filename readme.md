# INAVR - Custom fork of Inav

This is an unofficial version of Inav, thus the added "R" to the end and also different versioning numbers.

I started this fork to be able to share with the rest of the community some changes and improvements which I have been using on my own planes and quads for quite some time. 

Most of the changes so far are focused on the DJI O3 OSD, which the official implementation has left a lot to be desired, and internal politics prevented most of these improvements from being merged into the main Inav code. 

Here's an example of the O3 OSD that's possible with this fork:

These changes are added on top of the most recently released official version of Inav (7.1.1).

Compiled binaries from the code in this branch are available [in this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ylWco9k0QQajGhIPQsC12iD4LPA3YMZ_?usp=sharing). Look under the v7.2.x sub-folder.

The software is still Inav through and through, so all the steps for flashing, configuring, tuning and adjusting are the same as the ones for the official version. 

To flash from the compiled binaries:
* Go into the firmware flasher screen of the Inav Configurator
* Click the "Load firmware [Local]" button (on the bottom right of the window)
* Select the .hex file you have downloaded to your computer (make sure you downloaded the correct target for your FC)
* Make sure "full chip erase" option is selected (on the top left of the window)
* Click "Flash firmware"

> The same diff-all method of transferring settings between flashes applies and can be used.

Below is the text from the official Inav readme.

# INAV - navigation capable flight controller

# F411 PSA

> INAV no longer accepts targets based on STM32 F411 MCU.

> INAV 7 is the last INAV official release available for F411 based flight controllers. The next milestone, INAV 8 will not be available for F411 boards.

# PosHold, Navigation and RTH without compass PSA

Attention all drone pilots and enthusiasts,

Are you ready to take your flights to new heights with INAV 7.1? We've got some important information to share with you.

INAV 7.1 brings an exciting update to navigation capabilities. Now, you can soar through the skies, navigate waypoints, and even return to home without relying on a compass. Yes, you heard that right! But before you launch into the air, there's something crucial to consider.

While INAV 7.1 may not require a compass for basic navigation functions, we strongly advise you to install one for optimal flight performance. Here's why:

üõ∞Ô∏è Better Flight Precision: A compass provides essential data for accurate navigation, ensuring smoother and more precise flight paths.

üåê Enhanced Reliability: With a compass onboard, your drone can maintain stability even in challenging environments, low speeds and strong wind.

üöÄ Minimize Risks: Although INAV 7.1 can get you where you need to go without a compass, flying without one may result in a bumpier ride and increased risk of drift or inaccurate positioning.

Remember, safety and efficiency are paramount when operating drones. By installing a compass, you're not just enhancing your flight experience, but also prioritizing safety for yourself and those around you.

So, before you take off on your next adventure, make sure to equip your drone with a compass. It's the smart choice for smoother flights and better navigation.

Fly safe, fly smart with INAV 7.1 and a compass by your side!
